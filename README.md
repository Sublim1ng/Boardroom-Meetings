# Examing Conflict in Corporate Board Room Discussions 
Capstone Project <br>

## Background
Board meetings are crucial components of a company's governance. In these meetings, CEOs, directors, unions, financial sectors, and other stakeholders report on the firm's recent performance, strategic decisions, and organizational challenges. Conflicts, disagreements, and disputes often arise due to differing opinions, goals, and interests. If managed effectively, these conflicts can lead to healthier decision-making. However, poor management can harm the corporate environment and, in severe cases, lead to bankruptcy.
## Data
I obtained data from a publicly traded company that went bankrupt several decades ago. The dataset consists of text files containing records of board meetings over four years, organized sentence by sentence. Each sentence has been hand-coded by individuals in the past. The codes are enclosed in brackets, for example, [1,2,2a,5], where each component represents the sentence number, the person speaking, the category of verbal contribution, and the topic category, respectively. Due to privacy concerns, I am not allowed to share any specific details of the data here on GitHub.
## Goal
This project aims to use data analytics methods and generative AI to analyze board meeting transcripts. We seek to understand how conflicts arise in high-stakes situations. By identifying specific individuals, patterns, or precursors to conflicts, we hope to gain insights into the dynamics of board meetings, explore ways to resolve these conflicts, and, if possible, predict conflicts under predefined conditions.
## Notebooks
- 01: Import data and create Pandas data frames to store them.
- 02: Ask Claude2 to determine a topic and a verbal contribution category for each sentence, then compare these with pre-existing codes to calculate accuracy.
- 03: Identify simple precursors, such as word frequency, that lead to the verbal contribution category "4h," representing conflicts, disagreements, and attacks.
- 04: Analyze which topics and verbal contribution categories most frequently precede "4h."
- 05: Conduct further analysis on verbal contribution and topic categories.
- 06: Examine sentences following instances coded as "4h."
- 07: Compare the percentage of verbal contributions and topic categories before "4h" with the same percentages from a randomly selected set of consecutive sentences.
- 08: Create a folder containing stress and cooperativeness levels, ranging from 1 to 5, generated by Claude2. Then, construct flow plots of stress and cooperativeness for each board meeting.
