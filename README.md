# Conflict in Corporate Board Room Discussions 
Capstone Project <br>
Ningyu Han
## Background
Board meetings are crucial components of a company's governance. In these meetings, CEOs, directors, unions, financial sectors, and other stakeholders report on the firm's recent performance, strategic decisions, and organizational challenges. Conflicts, disagreements, and disputes often arise due to differing opinions, goals, and interests. If managed effectively, these conflicts can lead to healthier decision-making. However, poor management can harm the corporate environment and, in severe cases, lead to bankruptcy.
## Data
I obtained data from a publicly traded company that went bankrupt several decades ago. The dataset consists of text files containing records of board meetings over four years, organized sentence by sentence. Each sentence has been hand-coded by individuals in the past. The codes are enclosed in brackets, for example, [1,2,2a,5], where each component represents the sentence number, the person speaking, the category of verbal contribution, and the topic category, respectively. Due to privacy concerns, I am not allowed to share any specific details of the data here on GitHub.
## Goal
This project aims to apply data analytics methods and generative AI to analyze board meeting transcripts. We seek to understand how conflicts arise in high-stakes situations. By identifying specific patterns or precursors to conflicts, we hope to gain insights into the dynamics of board meetings, explore ways to resolve these conflicts, and if possible, predict conflicts under predefined conditions.
