# Capstone Project -- Examining Conflict in Corporate Board Room Discussions 
## Background
Board meetings are crucial components of a company's governance. In these meetings, CEOs, directors, unions, financial sectors, and other stakeholders report on the firm's recent performance, strategic decisions, and organizational challenges. Conflicts, disagreements, and disputes often arise due to differing opinions, goals, and interests. If managed effectively, these conflicts can lead to healthier decision-making. However, poor management can harm the corporate environment and, in severe cases, lead to bankruptcy.
