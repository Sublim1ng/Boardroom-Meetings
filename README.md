# Boardroom Meetings

## Notebooks
- 01: Import data and create Pandas data frames to store them.
- 02: Ask Claude2 to determine a topic and a verbal contribution category for each sentence, then compare these with pre-existing codes to calculate accuracy.
- 03: Identify simple precursors, such as word frequency, that lead to the verbal contribution category "4h," representing conflicts, disagreements, and attacks.
- 04: Analyze which topics and verbal contribution categories most frequently precede "4h."
- 05: Conduct further analysis on verbal contribution and topic categories.
- 06: Examine sentences following instances coded as "4h."
- 07: Compare the percentage of verbal contributions and topic categories before "4h" with the same percentages from a randomly selected set of consecutive sentences.
- 08: Create a folder containing stress and cooperativeness levels, ranging from 1 to 5, generated by Claude2. Then, construct flow plots of stress and cooperativeness for each board meeting.
