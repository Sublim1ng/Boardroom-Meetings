    "Analysis: Mac's lack of response and obvious discomfort creates an awkward and tense mood. Ralph becomes irritated with the lack of substantive answers and harshly states that many problems need to be addressed, not just one. His curt response heightens the strained atmosphere. Overall, Mac's avoidance escalates frustration and leads to Ralph's overt impatience. \n",

    "\"[c:12,03,4i,10]\",herb chooses not to respond <br>\n",

    "Analysis: The mood grows increasingly tense as Mac avoids answering directly.

    "The following transcripts including the sentences in the board meetings across serveral months. You will see within the brackets, the third component represents verbal contribution categories.

Look at the conversation that takes place before each 4h case. what is the most common pattern of discussion immediately prior to a 4h? When we talked about patterns of discussion immediately prior to a 4h, can you use the verbal contribution categories of those preceding sentences? You should get the pattern from not only one preceding sentence."

    "Based on reviewing the transcripts, the most common pattern of discussion immediately prior to a \"4h\" (disagreement/conflict/attack) seems to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Someone makes a statement or raises a question (often coded as \"1b\", \"1c\", \"1d\", or \"4d\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is some back and forth discussion with multiple people chiming in (coded as \"05\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The disagreement/\"4h\" then emerges, often in response to or building on the initial statement/question and the subsequent discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"[c:11,02,1b,03]\", Mac gives an explanation \n",
    "- \"[c:12,08,05,03]\", Discussion between Mac, John, and Fry  \n",
    "- \"[c:13,11,4h,03]\", Ralph still wants to know why the plant is losing money\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"[c:09,04,1b,05]\", John explains the retailer adjustments process\n",
    "- \"[c:10,08,05,05]\", Fry and John discuss \n",
    "- \"[c:11,11,4h,05]\", Ralph attacks the diffuse language in the financial statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"[c:69,03,1b,10]\", Herb reports on meetings with workers\n",
    "- \"[c:70,11,05,10]\", Ralph and Dick Clark ask about preparation time for meetings\n",
    "- \"[c:71,11,4h,10]\", Ralph argues more time is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, the pattern tends to be: statement/question -> group discussion -> disagreement/conflict emerging from that discussion. The categories leading up to the 4h are often 1b, 1c, 1d, 4d, 05."
