    "without specific category limits, here is an analysis of the sentiments that tend to precede the '4h' (Disagreements, conflicts, attacks) verbal contribution code in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Exchange**: '4h' often follows the sharing of information, whether it's someone providing details ('1b'), seeking more information ('1c'), or attempting to guide the flow of discussion ('3b'). The disagreement sometimes springs from discrepancies in the information provided by different parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Interests**: Arguments related to advancing specific agendas, like those of management ('4e1'), the union ('4e2'), or the company ('4g') often lead to conflicts if the interests are seen as misaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evasiveness**: When someone is evading questions or discussions ('4i'), it can cause frustration that boils over into open disagreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Statements**: Even when someone expresses support ('2b') for another's argument, there may be disagreement from others who feel an alternative position is being overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Concerns**: Discussions about the company's finances ('03') frequently lead to disagreement, especially regarding the causes of financial trouble and how to address it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Issues**: Problems related to manufacturing and operations ('09') also elicit differences of opinion on root causes and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unions and Contracts**: Negotiations and debates over unions ('10') and contracts often contain inherent conflicts of interest that lead to disputes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits and Management**: Disagreements also commonly spring up around benefits ('08'), management changes ('04'), sales and marketing ('05'), procurement ('12'), and other frequent board discussion topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, '4h' disagreements tend to follow conversations where interests are not aligned, information gaps exist, or the potential for disputes is already ripe based on the topic. A lack of trust and transparency tends to create the environment for open conflict."
